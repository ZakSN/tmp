1. makefile implementation needs to be improved
	basic idea:
		'make' should produce all of the object files for this director's
		class
		'make test' should produce a test program that tests this class
	problem:
		I think multiplt 'make test' don't update files properly...
		I've been very carefull to always 'make clean' and then 'make test'
		this could use some looking into...
2. character deletetion with the current buffer/display doesn't work
	problem:
		deleteing a character causes display to print a random(?) char
		under the cursor... not sure if this is a problem with buffer
		display
3. add a gitignore [DONE (works I think)]
	basic idea:
		I don't want to commit  builds or swap files acidently
		I think a .gitignore would help with this. I just need to learn
		syntax. need to do this. added a gitignore... testing...
4. namespaces?
	basic idea:
		ncurses supplies lots of loose functions some of which have name
		collisions with functions that I'm defining. right now I'm working
		around this by putting all of the ncurses header into its own
		namespace
	problem:
		I don't really know what I'm doing and need to read about how
		namespaces work. regardless I'm pretty sure that my current
		solution is a hack
