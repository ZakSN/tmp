(T)ext (M)anipulation (P)rogram
A simple text editor written in c++. Relies on the ncusres library for linux.
Provides basic text editing functionality. Primarily intended as a learning
project.

this repository contains a sub-directory for each of the classes that make up tmp.
each sub-directory also includes a simple testMain that is used to test the class
before it is integrated into the greater project. 

since each sub-directory contains a test main() it can be thought of as it's own
simple but complete test program. to facilitate this running 'make test' in any
sub-dir will produce that class's test program. running 'make' in a given sub-dir
will only produce that class's object files. the idea is that as the project grows
any given test progrm might require object files from a number of other sub-dirs;
this is achieved by running make in each of the sub-dirs and then collecting the
.o files in the current directory. this means that the finished project will only
have to provide a main() in a "tmp_main" sub-dir, and can otherwise behave like a
test program.

This project should not be used in a mission critical application. It may not
behave predictably or safely. Don't say you weren't warned.
